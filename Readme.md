Algorithms
1. For an array of integers, find two numbers in the array that are sum equals a number
  For an array of integers, find if there're two numbers that are sum equals the sum of others elements
  
2. Merge two sorted arrays of integers

3. For a string of letters and numbers, check if the string contains two consecutive numbers that sum equals 10 and seperate by three conscutive three question marks (?).
  For example: ac4???fr5005???7??3 -> false
              ac4???fr6005???7??3 -> true (4???fr6 -> fulfill the requirement)
          
4. Reverse words in a sentence interanlly (without using additional array)

5. Gangsters and crimes problem
