**Algorithms**
1. For an array of integers, find two numbers in the array that are sum equals a number
  For an array of integers, find if there're two numbers that are sum equals the sum of others elements
  
2. Merge two sorted arrays of integers

3. For a string of letters and numbers, check if the string contains two consecutive numbers that sum equals 10 and separate by three consecutive three question marks (?).
  For example: ac4???fr5005???7??3 -> false
              ac4???fr6005???7??3 -> true (4???fr6 -> fulfill the requirement)
          
4. Reverse words in a sentence internally (without using additional array)

5. Gangsters and crimes problem

6. Rearrange Strings if each one next to another differing one character

7. Word Ladder problem (To list out all paths from start to goal word)

8. Given array of integers, find the maximal possible sum of some of its k consecutive elements.

9. A string is said to be beautiful if b occurs in it no more times than a; c occurs in it no more times than b; etc.

10. Given a valid email address, find its domain part (The domain name part of an email address may only consist of letters, digits, hyphens and dots.)

11. Election winner: Given an array of the numbers of votes given to each of the candidates so far, and an integer k equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election. (refer to ElectionWinner.java for details)
